            <p>This map provides a geographic view of our data. While our center point (Centurylink Field) appears to have a fair amount of crime reported, the area with most incidents is downtown Seattle. You can also see a hot spot in Capitol Hill. From this view it would appear that these three neighborhoods have the most concentrated reporting of crime from within this map's view.</p>

            <p>Not much crime reported on the beaches. Perhaps criminals can't swim.</p>
